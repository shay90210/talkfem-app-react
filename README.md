### React Components 

- React-BootStrap Components (Carousel, NavBar, Nav, container, Row, Col, etc.)
- Font Awesome
- Boostrap Social 
- Typeface Fonts 
- React-Router-DOM 
- MORE!

### HomePage 

The homepage slightly resembles my original bootstrap homepage where I created the carousel, navigation bar, and footer. I did experience some struggles which included the following:

- My background image from my original project would never show - instead I had to settle for a normal color for now. I am currently reviewing documentation and YouTube tutorials on how to incorporate a background image in React.

- The navigation bar in the main bar and the footer are not centering on the page the way I need it to. I am currently thinking about restructing the navbar to get my items centered.
